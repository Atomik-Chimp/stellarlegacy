Quick Notes
===========

1. Compile Problems

At this time, you must run the "pre-build" script before you run make.  It is
safe to run before or after "configure".  This is to create some parser files
needed for the build.  Hopefully this step will be removed in version 0.3.

2. Log file

The log file is written by default to log.out which can become quite large. In case
something went wrong (e.g. stellarlegacy crashed) please keep a copy of the log.out
file but do NOT send it to the mailing list (did I mention that log.out is a big 
file? ;-). 

You can disable the log file completly, by commenting out the following line in
common/defs.h (and you have to recompile of course):

#define LOG_ENABLED

Also you can reduce the number of checks and some extra log info if you comment out

#define SECURE_MODE

(the same file). Note that any change in defs.h probably causes a complete recompile
since almost all files depend on defs.h.
